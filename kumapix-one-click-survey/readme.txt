A simple, modern, and mobile-friendly popup survey to collect quick feedback from your website visitors.

== Description ==

KumaPix One Click Survey helps you understand your audience better by asking a simple question in a sleek, non-intrusive popup. Find out how visitors discovered your site, what they're looking for, or get any other quick feedback with just a single click.

The survey is designed to be fast, mobile-friendly, and fully customizable to match your brand's look and feel. It's triggered by exit intent (when a user is about to leave your site) or a custom time delay, ensuring a smooth user experience.

All submissions are neatly stored in your WordPress database, and you can view beautiful reports with charts and filterable data right from your admin dashboard.

Key Features:

One-Click Answers: Users can respond instantly by clicking a button.

Smart Triggers: Show the popup on exit intent or after a specified time delay.

Fully Customizable: Easily change the question, answers, and colors (background, text, buttons) to match your brand.

Modern & Responsive: Looks great and works perfectly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Thank You Message: After submission, a "Thank You" message appears briefly before the popup disappears.

Powerful Reporting: View all submissions, filter by date, and see a summary chart to analyze your data at a glance.

CSV Export: Download your survey data as a CSV file for further analysis.

Privacy-Focused: Collects only the answer and basic, non-identifiable location data (country/city). We do not store user IPs.

Clean Uninstall: All data and database tables are removed upon plugin uninstallation.

== Installation ==

Upload the kumapix-one-click-survey folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.

Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Navigate to the 'One Click Survey' menu in your WordPress admin dashboard to configure the settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I have more than one question? =

This plugin is designed for simplicity and effectiveness, focusing on a single question to maximize response rates. For now, only one survey question is supported.

= How is the user location determined? =

We use the user's IP address to make a one-time lookup for their country and city via a public API. The IP address itself is never stored in your database, ensuring user privacy.

= Does it affect site performance? =

No. The plugin is lightweight and its scripts are loaded asynchronously in the footer, so it will not impact your site's loading speed.
